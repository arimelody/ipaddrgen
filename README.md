# ipaddrgen 👩‍💻

## the funny ip address generator

a small cli program written in go that generates random ip addresses and "does things" to them.

**Q:** *"why would you make this?"*

**A:** I was very bored.

*legal disclaimer: no this isn't a "hacking" tool, it's a goofy piece of software that spits text out onto the screen and nothing more. I wholeheartedly encourage that this software be used in le funny hacking montage.*

## use it! ✨

[download](https://github.com/mellodoot/ipaddrgen/releases/latest) whichever version is compatible with your OS (if such a version isn't listed, I'm so sorry!), then run it via your terminal!

i.e. `./ipaddrgen-PLATFORM-ARCH`

for help with command-line arguments (for some fun customisation), try `./ipaddrgen -h`!

## build it! 📀

### requirements

- [go](https://go.dev/) (currently using 1.17.6)
- that's about it

### how

windows: `go build -o ./bin/ipaddrgen.exe ./src`

linux/mac: `go build -o ./bin/ipaddrgen ./src`

*alternatively, just run it with `go run ./src`*

enjoy! ❤
