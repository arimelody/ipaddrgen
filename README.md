# ipaddrgen 👩‍💻
### the funny ip address generator

a small cli program written in go that generates random ip addresses and "does things" to them. (often very slowly)

**Q:** *"why would you make this?"*

**A:** I was very bored.

# install 📀

### requirements:

- go
- that's about it

### how:

windows: `go build -o ./bin/ipaddrgen.exe`

linux: `go build -o ./bin/ipaddrgen`

mac: idk I've never built an executable for mac (should be about the same)
